### Back-End

- What are you using for your database? (SQLite3, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc…)
PostgreSQL

- What framework/language are you using? (many teams use NodeJS/express/knex)
NodeJS/express/knex

- How do you plan on interacting with your APIs? (REST API, GraphQL, etc...)
REST API or GraphQL

- What alternatives did you explore?
REST API or GraphQL

- Why did you decide on this combination? (what are the advantages?)
Familiarity with technology stack

- What potential challenges can you foresee? (what questions do you have about this implementation to which you don’t have answers?)
REST:  A lot of endpoints to write
GraphQL:  Not nearly as much familiarity

### Front-End

if your product has more than 1 platform, have a section like this for each platform.

- What Framework are you using for your FE? (React, React Native, Angular, Vue, etc...)
React/Redux
"axios": "^0.19.1",
"babel-loader": "^8.0.6",
"create-react-app": "^3.3.0",
"react": "^16.12.0",
"react-dom": "^16.12.0",
"react-redux": "^7.1.3",
"react-router": "^5.1.2",
"react-router-dom": "^5.1.2",
"react-scripts": "^3.3.0",
"react-share": "^4.0.1",
"reactdom": "^2.0.0",
"redux": "^4.0.5",
"redux-logger": "^3.0.6",
"redux-thunk": "^2.3.0",
"styled-components": "^5.0.0",
"video-react": "^0.14.1" (will be used to play audio maybe),
"webfontloader": "^1.6.28"

- What alternatives were considered?
asp.net/html/css

- Why did you decide on this framework over the alternatives (what are the advantages?)
more familiarity, better performance, better maintainability/testing/stabiility

- What potential challenges can you foresee using this framework?
Organization of components

### Styling Considerations

if your product has more than 1 platform, duplicate this for each platform.

- What styling library are you using?
styling components, tailwind css, traditional css/less

- What alternatives did you consider?
styling components, tailwind css, traditional css/less

- Why did you decide on this library?

- What potential challenges can you foresee?

### API Integrations

Create a section that answers these types of questions for each new API integration

- What Feature(s) is/are this API connected to?

- What will this API integration accomplish in the feature(s) to which it’s connected?

- What alternatives did you consider?

- Why did you decide on this solution? (what are the advantages?)

- What are the potential challenges can you foresee?
